# Weather Station – Lab 1

This is the lab assignment for the course "Embedded Systems" at THD, conducted by Prof. Tobias Schaffer. The project demonstrates the use of a Raspberry Pi 5 and Sense HAT to collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure), display it on the LED matrix, and visualize it using matplotlib.

## 📁 Contents

- `main.py`: Python code used to run the sensor and collect data
- `images/`: Terminal screenshot and sensor plot
- `report/`: Lab report in both `.pdf` and `.tex` formats
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries

## 🔧 Requirements

- Raspberry Pi or 5
- Sense HAT
- Python 3.8+
- SSH access (e.g., PuTTY)
- VNCviewer

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python main.py# thd-em-lab1-weather-station
```
